  heading: Why Kaldi?
  text: Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

    text: We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
      independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a variety
      of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and local
      communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
      availability.
values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
